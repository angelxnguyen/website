<p>###Introduction for this Data Analysis Project:</p>
<p><em>In this project, I will be analyzing two datasets, <strong>lifeexpect</strong> and <strong>happiness2015</strong>. The dataset <strong>lifeexpect</strong> comes from the World Health Organization (WHO), and it contains information on global life expectancies. In addition, it contains a number of health variables contributing to the life expectancies. A few of these are GDP, diseases, schooling, and resources. The second dataset <strong>happiness2015</strong> comes from The World Happiness Report, and it consists of information on global happiness in addition to variables contributing to this happiness value. A few of these variables are scores for freedom, generosity, family, and trust in government.</em></p>
<p><em>I chose to conduct an analysis on these two datasets because I wanted to determine whether there was a relationship between a country’s life expectancy and how happy its inhabitants are. I am predicting that countries with higher life expectancies will have higher scores of happiness. I will also be looking at the overall happiness and life expectancies of the regions that these countries belong to.</em></p>

<p>###Introducing the Two Datasets</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lifeexpect &lt;- read.csv(&quot;C:/Users/njare/Desktop/website/content/lifeexpect.csv&quot;)
happiness2015 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;C:/users/njare/Desktop/website/content/happiness2015.csv&quot;)

library(dplyr)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;:
## 
##     filter, lag</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;:

<pre class="r"><code>life2015 &lt;- lifeexpect %&gt;% filter(Year &gt;= 2015)</code></pre>
<p><em>The dataset ‘lifeexpect’ contained information from the years 2000 to 2015, but the dataset ‘happiness2015’ only contained information for the year 2015. I chose to only look at information for the year 2015 because of this. Additionally, both datasets were predominantly tidy to begin with.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>###Joining the Two Datasets</p>
<pre class="r"><code>joined &lt;- life2015%&gt;% inner_join(happiness2015, by=&quot;Country&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Column `Country` joining factors with different levels, coercing to
## character vector</code></pre>
<p><em>I decided to utilize the join function, inner_join(), because it would drop any of the rows in either dataset without a match, keeping only the rows with matches on the ID variable that I chose, which was ‘Country’. This is why some of the countries did not make it to the ‘joined’ dataset. Only the Countries found in both of the datasets would make it to the ‘joined’ dataset, 135 countries. Additionally, I did not want to introduce any new NAs, so this was the join function that I went with.</em></p>

<p>###Generating Summary Statistics</p>

<p><em>I created a new dataset from <strong>joined</strong> and named it <strong>joined.1</strong>.

<p><em>Looking at this kmeans plot above, there are 10 clusters. Clustering is used in order to group together data points which are most similar to one another. This could reveal that each of these clusters are a different region, which is similar to the plot that was produced previously when plotting happiness score against life expectancy and coloring the data points based on their respective regions.</em></p>

<p>###Conclusion</p>
<p><em>In conclusion, when looking at life expectancy values and happiness scores across different regions of the world, it is apparent that countries with longer life expectancy generally have higher happiness scores. There seems to be great variation between each of the regions for both life expectancy and happiness scores. This could be due to a number of reasons such as the economy, eradication of diseases, government trust/presence; however, further testing would need to be performed to determine what affects life expectancy and happiness to vary around the world.</em></p>
