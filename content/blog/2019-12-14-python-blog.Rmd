## Introduction:

In this blog, I will be writing about what I have learned in a Computational Biology course I took. Now if  you were expecting a blog about snakes, I am sorry to disappoint; however, I promise this blog about the language Python is just as riveting! In this course, we were briefly introduced to Python. I will be including a few things that I found were interesting in this blog post such as using the package "Reticulate", regular expression, and some things about python bioinformatics.

## Calling Python from R and Reticulate:

Firstly, I learned that through the package "Reticulate" in R, I am able to call on R and then allow Python and R to talk to each other. This means that I can use R to read and make adjustments to the data, then use this data with Python and matplotlib to then graph it. This is executed below:

---

```{r}
library(dplyr)
faithful
summary(faithful)
faithful <- mutate (faithful, eruptions_hr = eruptions/60)
faithful <- mutate (faithful, waiting_hr = waiting/60)
head(faithful)
```

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
plot1=plt.scatter(r.faithful["eruptions_hr"], r.faithful["waiting_hr"])
plt.show(plot1)
```

I was able to use R in order to call in the data that I will be using, then with the package "dplyr", I was able to create two new variables in the dataset, Faithful. I used the function mutate() in order to convert the two variables from minutes to hours. I then used this altered dataset in Python and was able to create a scatterplot with "reticulate" and "matplotlib".

## Regular Expression

Regular expression can be used in order to search through a large paragraph or chunk of information and find specific patterns that you are looking for. You can use 

```{python}


```
