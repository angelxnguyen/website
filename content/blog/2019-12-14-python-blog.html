<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this blog, I will be writing about what I have learned in a Computational Biology course I took. Now if you were expecting a blog about snakes, I am sorry to disappoint; however, I promise this blog about the language Python is just as riveting! In this course, we were briefly introduced to Python. I will be including a few things that I found were interesting in this blog post.</p>
